# Document-Scanner-using-OpenCV
## Introduction
- This repository contains a Python script for a basic document scanner using OpenCV. The script captures video from your webcam, processes the frames to detect and highlight the largest quadrilateral (assumed to be the document), and transforms the perspective to present a top-down view of the document.


## Features
- Real-time video capture from the webcam.
- Preprocessing of frames for contour detection.
- Detection and highlighting of the largest quadrilateral in the frame.
- Perspective transformation to obtain a top-down view of the document.

### Prerequisites
Python (3.x recommended)
